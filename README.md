## Usage Rules for AI and Developers

1.  **Do Not Modify Styles:** The class names and HTML structure of these components are considered the single source of truth. They must be implemented *exactly* as provided. Do not add, remove, or change any classes.
2.  **Content is Variable:** The inner text, `src` attributes for images, and `href` attributes for links are placeholders and should be populated with the appropriate content for the new implementation.
3.  **Respect the Structure:** Do not alter the semantic structure (e.g., changing an `<article>` to a `<div>` or altering the heading levels) unless explicitly instructed.

# My Reusable Component Library

This repository contains a set of reusable, semantic HTML components styled with utility-first CSS. This document serves as the manifest for all available components.

When instructed, please refer to this manifest to understand the available components and use the linked files as the single source of truth for structure and styling.
