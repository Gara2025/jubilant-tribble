# Collection: Product Page Components

This folder contains a collection of reusable HTML snippets specifically designed for building the body of our product pages.

These components are designed to be placed inside one of the main page templates (like the "Hero + Sticky Nav" shell) and rely on the Global Custom Styles to render correctly.
