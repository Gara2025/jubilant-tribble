# Dark Context Components & Snippets

This folder contains components and snippets designed to work on dark backgrounds, ensuring text and links remain readable. The core principle is the use of the `.on-dark` class.

For detailed rules on how `.on-dark` works, please refer to the main project **STYLE_GUIDE.md**.
