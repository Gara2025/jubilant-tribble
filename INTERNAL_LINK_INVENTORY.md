Hello! I am the Creative Director for this project. I need your help as my Lead Researcher and Content Strategist to create a new, high-quality article for my website. Please follow our established collaborative, two-phase process.

### **Phase 0: Context Analysis (Your First Step)**

Before you do anything else, you must re-familiarize yourself with our design system AND our website's structure.

1.  **Go to our GitHub Repository:** `https://github.com/Gara2025/jubilant-tribble`
2.  **Analyze the `manifest.json` file:** Your blueprint for all available components.
3.  **Analyze the `STYLE_GUIDE.md` file:** Your rulebook for all brand styles and effects.
4.  **Analyze the `INTERNAL_LINK_INVENTORY.md` file:** Your master list of available internal links and their associated keywords.

Acknowledge when you have completed this full analysis. All work you produce MUST strictly adhere to this system.

### **Phase 1: Collaborative Research & Content Strategy**

**Article Topic:** `[Your Article Topic Here]`

#### **A. My Initial Creative Brief (Your Foundation)**
*(This section remains the same)*

#### **B. Your Research & Synthesis Tasks (Your Main Job)**

Now, using my brief as your foundation, your job is to build upon it.

1.  **Enrich & Expand:** *(This task remains the same)*
2.  **Suggest Images:** *(This task remains the same)*
3.  **Propose a Synthesized Outline & Linking Plan:** Combine my brief and your new research into a single, cohesive proposal. The proposal must include:
    *   A detailed article outline with semantic `<h1>` and `<h2>` headings.
    *   A plan for where all key data points and images will be placed.
    *   Suggestions for which of our pre-built snippets to use.
    *   **NEW & IMPROVED -> An "Internal Linking Plan"**: Present this as a simple table with two columns: "Keyword/Phrase to be Linked" and "Target URL from Inventory." This is your specific proposal for which links to create.

**IMPORTANT: Do not write any HTML yet. This proposal is for my review. Wait for my final approval.**

### **Phase 2: HTML Assembly (After My Approval)**

Once I approve your outline and linking plan, you will build the complete, final HTML file.

**Your Tasks:**

1.  **Use the Main Shell (`page-template-hero-sticky-nav`)** and populate all its placeholders.
2.  **Assemble the Main Content:**
    *   Write the full article content based on the approved outline.
    *   Structure the content using the reusable snippets from your library.
    *   **NEW & EXPLICIT COMMAND -> Implement the Internal Linking Plan:** As you write the body of the article, you **must** seamlessly integrate the links from the approved plan. When you encounter a target keyword or phrase from the plan, you must create a link to its corresponding target URL.
    *   Add citations for all new data.
    *   The final output should be a single, complete block of HTML code.
