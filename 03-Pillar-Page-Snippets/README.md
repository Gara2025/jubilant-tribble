# Pillar Page Content Snippets

This folder contains a collection of advanced content blocks (like comparison tables, feature cards, CTAs, etc.) that were originally designed for a pillar page.

## VERY IMPORTANT: How to Use These Snippets

These snippets are **NOT standalone**. They are just the HTML structure and will not look correct on their own.

They **MUST** be placed inside the **`011-Hero+stickyTOC+FAQ+other-bottom-content.html`** template. That template file contains the necessary CSS `<style>` block that makes all of these snippets render correctly.


## Available Snippets

This is a visual guide to the reusable blocks available in the `/_snippets` subfolder.
